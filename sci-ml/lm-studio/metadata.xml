		LM Studio is a desktop application for discovering, downloading, and running
		large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer. It provides a user-friendly
		interface for working with various open-source language models without requiring
		cloud services or subscriptions.

		Features include:
		- Run popular LLMs locally (GPT-OSS, Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek, and more)
		- Private and offline operation - no data sent to the cloud
		- Cross-platform support with native performance
		- OpenAI-compatible API server for integration with existing tools
		- Python and JavaScript SDKs for programmatic access
		- Command-line interface (lms) for automation
		- Model management and download capabilities
		- Free for both personal and commercial use

		The application is built on Electron and provides GPU acceleration support
		for improved performance when running models. Models are downloaded on-demand
		and stored locally in the user's home directory.
